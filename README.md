# Data-Reporting-of-Student-Course-Registration
This python application will be useful for the academic staff and lecturers to monitor the student registration process. It also helps in finding the most registered course for a particular semester by which they can increase the class strength of that particular class or can introduce additional sections for that particular course. My application involves creating a graphical user interface which interacts with the PostgreSQL database for storing the student registration records. The Student Registration GUI application has four tabs namely Add Student Details, Update Student Details, Delete student Details and Report (displays bar plot of courses registered).
